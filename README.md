# Hi, I’m Sharmi Islam 

M.Sc. in Data Science | Eye-Tracking & Deep Learning | PhD Aspirant  

I am passionate about applying AI and deep learning to understand human reading behavior and language proficiency. My research focuses on modeling eye-tracking data to predict second language (L2) reading proficiency using advanced neural network architectures.
